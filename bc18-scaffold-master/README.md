# Scaffold for Battlecode 2018

This is how you run games!  To start, install docker, and make sure it's started.  

### Unix instructions

Clone the repo, and run `sudo sh run.sh` in the directory.  Wait a while to download our code, then finally it will say:

`To play games open http://localhost:6147/run.html in your browser`

Follow its instructions, and start runnin them games! (warning, socket.bc18map may be buggy rn)

### Windows instructions

Coming soon...
